# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of commonly used machine learning algorithms implemented in **`Python/Numpy`**. No other third-party libraries (except `Matplotlib`) are used. 

Algorithms are implemented in IPython notebooks. Before starting the coding section, we presented the basic intuition of the algorithm along with necessary mathematical derivations.

Optimized and computationally efficient algorithms were not our intention and we just wanted to produce an accessible collection of algorithms for students and software practitioner.
