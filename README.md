### :loudspeaker: Introduction

This repository contains a collection of commonly used machine learning algorithms implemented in **`Python/Numpy`**. No other third-party libraries (except **`Matplotlib`**) are used. 

Algorithms are implemented in `Jupyter` notebooks. Before starting the coding section, we presented the basic intuition of the algorithm along with necessary mathematical derivations.

Optimized and computationally efficient algorithms were not our intention and we just wanted to produce an accessible collection of algorithms for students and software practitioner. 

### :hammer: Usage

If you want to read `Jupyter` notebooks just like static document, please follow the `nbviewer` links or else to execute notebooks locally use the following instructions.
1. Clone the repository: **`https://github.com/upul/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-From-Scratch.git`**
2. Go to local repository location: **`cd Machine-Learning-Algorithms-From-Scratch`**
3. Run notebooks: **`jupyter notebook`**  

### :capital_abcd: Prerequisite

In order to successfully following `Jupyter` notebooks, we assume that you have a basic understanding of the following areas.

1. Basic programming experience in Python
2. Introductory knowledge of linear algebra
3. Basic probability theory
4. Basic multi-variate calculus

### :open_file_folder: Resources
#### :books: Text Books

Following books were immensely helpful when we were preparing these `Jupyter` notebooks. We believe these books should be available on every Machine Learning/Data Science practitioner's bookshelves. 

#### :movie_camera: MOOCs and Videos
Following MOOCs and Youtube playlists are simply amazing. If you want to broaden your Machine Learning knowledge I'm pretty sure those MOOCs and videos will be really helpful.
